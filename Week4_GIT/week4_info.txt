Objective: IDevelop a data-driven surrogate for a simple model.
Level: Intermediate

Demos:
pulse2d_simplemodel: run a simple physical model and view output
pulse2d_iter: run the simple model 100,000 times to create training data for an MLP
pulse2d_MLP_preprocess: preprocess training data
pulse2d_MLP: train a data-driven surrogate (MLP) for the simple model (pulse2d)
